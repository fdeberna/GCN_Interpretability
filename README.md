# Graph Neural Network Study

Notebook with some simple implementations of Graph Neural Networks, namely GCN and GAT architectures. It contains methods to visualize feature superposition and graph-related structures.[These are the calculations behind my article on Medium.](https://medium.com/the-quantastic-journal/interpretability-of-graph-neural-networks-an-exploratory-study-of-nodes-features-and-attention-70799aec74dd)
